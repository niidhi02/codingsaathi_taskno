                Sushmita was born in the Bengali-speaking Sen family on November 19, 1975 in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. </br>
                Her family consists of her dad, Shubeer, a former Indian Air Force Wing Commander; mom, Subhra, Jewelry Designer and owner of a Dubai-based store.   </br>
                She has two siblings, a sister named Neelam, who is married to Nauman Malik, and a brother named Rajeev.  </br>
                Subhra's dad was a poet.She attended different schools in Jorhat, and Nagpur, but spend the majority of her schooling days in the Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute and Air Force Silver School in Delhi.  </br>
                She was regarded as a tomboy and spent most of her times with boys. </br>
                Since the schools were Hindi medium, she could not speak English until she was 16 years of age. </br>
                She subsequently not only mastered English, but became an English Honors student, and also obtained a degree in Journalism. </br>
                Due to her place of birth she can speak Urdu flawlessly. </br>
                Her first public appearance was at the Air Force Club Contest at the age of 15. She did a few fashion shows thereafter. </br>
                Then during 1994 she decided to be a participant in Miss India beauty pageant, fully aware that she was being pitted against the reigning favorite, Aishwarya Rai. </br>
                Sushmita took everyone by surprise when she was crowned Miss India while Aishwarya had to content with being the First Runner-up. </br>
                Both beauties went on to win Miss Universe and Miss World titles respectively. </br>
                Ironically the final outfit for Miss Universe for Sushmita was made by a little-known Meena Bazar tailor, and her mom. </br>
